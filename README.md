# Choose Gang Free — Reimagined (Static Site)

A county-hosted, accessible, mobile-friendly reimagining of **Choose Gang Free**, built as a static site (no Node build required).

See the two distributions in this folder:
- **/relative**: path-agnostic (great for county hosting under any subpath)
- **/gh-pages**: configured for GitHub Pages at `/choosegangfree/`

## Quick GitHub Pages steps
- Upload **/gh-pages** contents to your repo root.
- In Settings → Pages, choose **Deploy from a branch**, **Branch: main**, **Folder: / (root)**.
- Visit: https://sssamiam2-prog.github.io/choosegangfree/

## Quick County hosting steps
- Upload **/relative** anywhere on your county server (e.g. `/sites/gang-prevention/`).
- No base href needed; links are already relative.
